## Special Thanks goes to: 
•	Creative Tim for the custom developed components that eased the development of the application.


During the development of the application, I have used many existing resources from awesome developers. I want to thank them for providing their tools open source:\
•	MUI - The React UI library for faster and easier web development.\
•	React ChartJS 2 - Simple yet flexible React charting for designers & developers.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
